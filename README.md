#### Webpack works as follow:

* Read an entry file Javascript `entry: "./index.js",`
* Resolve all dependencies _(in this case only Js scripts)_ producing a _bundle_ `output: {filename: "bundle.js}"`; bundle is added in html page
  *  _Dynamic Import_ (Ref: https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)
     * 'script_1.js' and 'script_2.js' are dynamically imported
  *  'script_3.js' is imported synchronously
* Produce _source-map_
* Serve project with _devServer_ on port 3001
